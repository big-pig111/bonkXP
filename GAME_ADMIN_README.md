```json
{
  "isRunning": true,
  "nextReset": 1640995200000,
  "gameDuration": 20,
  "resetInterval": 2,
  "lastUpdate": 1640995200000
}
```

### Settings (`/settings`)
```json

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Real-time Synchronization
- Use Firebase Realtime Database for real-time data synchronization
- All players and backend management interface update in real-time

### 2. Time Control
- Backend uniformly manages game time
- Use timestamps to ensure all clients are synchronized

### 3. State Management
- Game state stored in Firebase
- Clients listen for state changes and update accordingly

## Important Notes

1. **Permission Control**: Currently no permission verification, anyone can access the backend management interface
2. **Data Security**: Reset operations will clear all room data, please use with caution
3. **Network Requirements**: Stable network connection required to ensure real-time synchronization
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Recommend using modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Game Not Synchronized**
   - Check network connection
